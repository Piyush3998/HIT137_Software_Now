# Explanation of Corrections
# 1. Variable names corrected for readability and clarity.
# 2. Changed 'tybony_inevoyr' to 'yummy_inventory' for better understanding.
# 3. Adjusted function and loop logic to reflect standard Python practices.
# 4. Used 'global' keyword to ensure 'yummy_inventory' is accessed properly.
# 5. Corrected the use of methods (like .remove()) to ensure valid operations.
